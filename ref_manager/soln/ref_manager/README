Weekly Exercise 3: Reference Manager

The files "ref_manager.cpp" and "ref_manager.h" create a basic reference manager. Several pointer to strings that are stored in heap are put into an array. If any address has 0 pointers pointing towards it, it is added to a garbage array to free the memory the next time garbageCollect() is called.

To compile this program, first run "make" and then run ./we3_solution.

It can take several queries.

c <pointer_index_to_replace> <length_of_string> <string>
This will replace a pointer in the pointer array to a new pointer, pointing to the inputted string.

p <pointer1_index> <pointer2_index>
This will make pointer1 now point to the memory address that pointer2 is pointing to.

q <pointer_index>
This will print the string that the pointer at "pointer_index" is pointing to.

e
This will exit the program.
